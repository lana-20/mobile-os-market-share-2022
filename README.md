# Mobile OS Market Share - Today

Mobile market [today](https://lana-20.github.io/mobile-os-market-share-2022/) looks much different from [10 years ago](https://lana-20.github.io/mobile-os-market-share-2012/). The market is dominated by two major vendors - Google (Android OS) and Apple (iOS).

I only need Android and iOS developers and testers, unless I choose [cross-platform](https://ionic.io/resources/articles/ionic-vs-react-native-a-comparison-guide#where-we-are-the-same) solutions.

Having two main platforms makes my job as QA easier. No more need to deal with [Windows phones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/windows-10-mobile-end-of-support) or [Blackberry OS](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/08/our-commitment-to-bb10-and-some-changes-to-blackberry-legacy-services).
Of course, there is always a tradeoff along with the benefit. Both Android and iOS come with their own challenges, which is a much broader topic.

The allocation changes by country and region.

The U.S. market is dominated by iOS. Although, for approximation purposes, I can say that Google and Apple shares have been dancing around the 50/50 split. The ticker has been consistently moving back and forth in either direction by a few percentages.

India is almost entirely serviced by Android:

## KaiOS
[KaiOS](https://www.kaiostech.com/help-center/) has a small market share (0.08%), however, companies like Meta develop for this platform. It's an OS for button phones. Despite the small share, this OS is essential enough for phones which are not yet full-blown smartphones, but are cheaper simpler button phones. KaiOS has its own app store ([KaiStore](https://www.kaiostech.com/apps-feature-phones-everything-need-know-kaistore/)), from where users can download the most popular apps for this OS.
